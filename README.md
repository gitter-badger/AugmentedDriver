*** 

The whole framework aims to simplify 3 aspects of writing JAVA E2E tests using WebDriver/Appium:
* Easy configuration for running tests and suites of tests in different browsers/devices, and simple out of the box integrations with SauceLabs and with CI systems, such as TeamCity
* Design so you are encourage to follow the [Page Object Model](https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/PageObjects), and to encourage separation of concerns for modularizing your suite.
* A think layer on top of WebDriver/Appium with handy functionality that helps the development of tests, both in speed of development and also reliability of the tests.

With this framework, At SalesforceIQ we were able to run 250+ (and adding every week) E2E Tests for Web, Android and IOS in less than 15 minutes, embedded in our TeamCity Integration with the help from SauceLabs
